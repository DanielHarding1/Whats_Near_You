## Description

A cocktail creation site that suggests which cocktails you can create based on which ingredients you have in your cupboard at home. The site will also tell you the location of local restaurants and what time they open and close.

### User Story

I want to be able to make a cocktail after inputting the ingredients that I have in my kitchen and I would like to find local places which serve food or drink.

### Accepance Criteria

The project is complete when the user can search for an ingredient and a list of possible cocktails is displayed, and they can search near locations on the map.

## Installation

This application is available on a web browser at [Cocktails Near You](https://danielharding1.github.io/Whats_Near_You/).
